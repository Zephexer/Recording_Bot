# Recording_Bot
A bot that can be used to record keystrokes and mouse clicks.
Mainly copied from https://github.com/learncodebygaming/enb_bot/tree/master/recording_bot.
I just added some functionality for games via pydirectinput.

To use make a "recordings folder"
Use recorder.py to record actions
Use playback.py to play back (make sure to change the .json file that is bing played)

Requires 
  - pynput
  - pyautogui
  - pydirectinput
